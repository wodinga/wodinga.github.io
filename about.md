Hey there! Welcome to my blog! My name is David Rafael Garcia. I am a graduate from Georgia Tech (CS '14). While at Tech my [threads][Threads] were Media and Information Internetworks.

I have a passion for computer science because I believe that computers are like a "bicycle for our minds," to quote Steve Jobs. That is, computers exponentially increase a person's creative potential because they can perform computational tasks at incredible speeds. This allows humans to focus on what we do best, which is to make art, engineer solutions, do science, and otherwise think creatively.

Most of all, I believe in personal computing. I am a not computer scientist because of the money or *just* because I'm a huge nerd. I love computers because I love how they affect my life and I want to do cool things with them. Let me put it this way. If we lived in lived in a world in which magic existed, why would you not want to be a wizard?

In this blog I will be writing about random projects that I do, technology that catches my interest, and nerding out about tools that make my life slightly easier or more interesting.
